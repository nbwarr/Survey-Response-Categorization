Polar bears and many other large mammals could die with little impact on humanity. Realistically, animals like pollinators are far more important to our survival., I want to give the polar bear a hug, This is happening due to climate change, Climate changes is showing the cons to natural selection. , This is our fault, we are the cause of this. Climate change is anthropogenic and humans are struggling to understand how bad of an impact itâ€™s happening, Good advertising and awareness, Our actions have direct impacts on the world's animals, not just humans., Global warming does play a factor in what our planet is experiencing, however, I feel it's the \"popular\" current topic and there are plenty of other issues to consider. It's hard to seperate the issue of global warming with politics, bias, and other forms of influence. I do believe global warming is a real and current issue but I am not confident the motives behind trying to address this problem is truly cemented in the betterment of our planet. , Only a bit longer until we'll be in their shoes and pass away with them, Global warming is the main cause of this issue that the government can't seem to address. , polar bears eat humans, We caused this, I wonder how many other polar bears are starving to this level., Addressing starving animals like polars bears mean addressing habitat encroachment. , global warming is getting out of hand , The impact of our actions on the rest of the inhabitants of the planet, This polar bear is extremely starving due to lack of food. the ice/snow is the background has fully melted due to the rising temperature of the planet. this is an evidence of how impactful climate change is to the lives of animals. , It's very difficult to see the impact that something we caused on the organisms around us, It was hard to watch; I sympathized with the polar bear and wondered to what extent human activity contributed to its state. , If more people witnessed this I wonder how people's behavior would change, I can't bring myself to watch it. I've been pursuing mental health services for 1 year and have yet to start any kind of treatment. Let's not add fuel to the flame., The impact we have created on the environment is reaching the tipping point where even if we begin to clean up our act, the world will keep degrading until there is nothing left for us to live on., :(, we did that!, Extremely shocking as I never thought a polar bear could be so skinny.
